## 

The original idea is to use three different sizes of LEDs, possible different colors. They are 4 0201 green, 4 0402 yellow, and 4 0603 red. All others are 0805.

Then it evolves into an easier plan:
* 10 LEDs are all size 0805, still three different colors.
* 4 0201 resistors
* 4 0402 resistors
* 2 0603 resistors

It is easier to know two different ends of 0805 LED than the tiny ones. The display might be better because of constant size of LED.

**The cathode of LED provided in the package has a grees bar on the back.**
