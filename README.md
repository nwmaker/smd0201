# SMD0201 Soldering Challenge Kit

## idea

The original idea is to use three different sizes of LEDs, possible different colors. They are 4 0201 green, 4 0402 yellow, and 4 0603 red. All others are 0805.

Then it evolves into an easier and cheaper plan:
* 10 LEDs are all size 0805, still three different colors.
* 4 0201 resistors
* 4 0402 resistors
* 2 0603 resistors

Resistors are cheap, the kit could include more without economical concern because the smaller components might jump around and go missing.

It is easier to know two different ends of 0805 LED than the tiny ones.

The display might be better because of constant size of LED.
